<h2>Hometown "Hero"</h2>
<p>Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Nick spent a lot of his younger days trying to figure out
where his path in life was going to take him. He spent a lot of time with many friends from different backgrounds
and different interests. He often felt the need to fit in, and sometimes, even lost his identity in the process.
However, Nick would never stop being curious on how life was going to go.</p>

<h2>Difficult Choices</h2>
<p>From a winding journey through the evolving landscape of Film and Digital Media, Nick's artistic drive ultimately found its powerful focus in the dynamic world of technology. Though the initial pursuit of a film career presented its challenges, this exploration paved the way for an exciting pivot. Armed with newfound momentum and key certifications, Nick encountered a pivotal decision point: cybersecurity, machine learning, IT, or web development? Drawing on his inherent understanding of Digital Media and design, the path to becoming a Web Developer ignited a clear sense of purpose. And so began Nick's exhilarating quest to master the full stack! </p>

<h2>What The Future Holds</h2>
<p>Having embarked on the exciting journey of web development, my focus now sharpens on deepening my skills and securing a fulfilling role as a remote fullstack engineer. The prospect of contributing to innovative projects from anywhere in the world fuels my drive, with potential horizons stretching to vibrant locales like Vancouver, British Columbia, the culturally rich Glasgow, Scotland, or the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. This ambition to work remotely not only aligns with the evolving tech landscape but also opens doors to personal growth and diverse experiences, making the pursuit of this career path even more compelling.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>My downtime involves a mix of engaging activities: I find satisfaction in the problem-solving of programming, and unwind by playing guitar and singing. To stay active, I regularly hit the gym for weightlifting sessions. I also enjoy getting outdoors and connecting with friends on hikes, appreciating both the exercise and the company.</p>
